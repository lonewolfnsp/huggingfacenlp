NLP with huggingface tramsfpr,er library

This repo contains my work with NLP using the huggingface transformer library which I think is a godsend for those trting to learn NLP. I have personally completed 
the DeepLearning.AI's NLP specialization which uses Trax but I've little idea how to do other tasks.. HuggingFace library makes it really easy to perform the usual tasks 
with custom dataset for training and even has courses to teach you how to do it. I've used custom dataset tp train the models and this repo is to help others who are 
interested to know how to do it. 

this is a test to see if SSH can work with github.
